Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.



class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        min_buy = float('inf')
        n = len(prices)
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(n):
            min_buy = min(min_buy, prices[i])
            max_profit = max(max_profit, prices[i]-min_buy)
        return max_profit
